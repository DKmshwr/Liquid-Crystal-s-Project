# Liquid-Crystal-s-Project
 Here are the main points from the Project:

Three FLC Series:
The dielectric behavior is reported for three **FLC** series: **QMn/m**, **En/m**, and **QVE n/m**.

We’ll do define these series and their properties.

**Complex Permittivity**:
The complex permittivity is used to determine:
-**Dielectric strength (∆ε)**
***Relaxation time (τr)**
+**Relaxation frequency (fr)**

**Temperature dependence of relaxation time and frequency.**
We will create functions or classes to calculate these quantities

Tilted Ferroelectric SmC Phase:*
The SmC* phase is observed using broadband dielectric spectroscopy.
We’ll need to model the SmC* phase and its properties.

**Temperature Dependence and Molecular Structure:**
The dielectric spectra depend on temperature and specific molecular structure.
We will incorporate temperature effects and molecular properties.

**Goldstone Mode and Transitions:**
A strong Goldstone mode is observed in the SmC* phase with a relaxation frequency of ~kHz.
The real and imaginary parts of the complex permittivity change near the SmC*-N*/SmA* transition.
We will simulate these transitions and mode behavior.

**Dielectric Strength Variation:**
The dielectric strength varies with the length of the alkyl chain and the connecting unit of constituent molecules.
We’ll need to model this variation.

__Given these points, we will create a Python code that simulates the dielectric behavior of the described FLC series.__
